Week 1: Emotion-Aware Chatbot 🤖

This is a simple chatbot project built with Python, NLTK, and Streamlit that can analyze user emotions from text input. The chatbot processes the text by:

Tokenizing the input into words using ToktokTokenizer.

Removing stopwords (common words like "the", "is", etc.) to focus on meaningful words.

Removing punctuation to clean the text.

Lemmatizing words using WordNetLemmatizer (converts words to their base form, e.g., “missed” → “miss”).

Performing sentiment analysis with NLTK’s SentimentIntensityAnalyzer to determine the emotion of the user message.

The bot categorizes emotions as:

Positive → displays a happy response.

Negative → displays an empathetic response.

Neutral → displays an acknowledgment.

The UI is built using Streamlit, allowing users to input messages and instantly see the bot’s response and sentiment scores.
